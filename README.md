## For site developers

### Build and run locally

To build a local copy, run the following:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

### PR and preview

Once you're happy with your local changes, please make a PR **against the `main` branch**. Including detailed notes on your PR - particularly screenshots to depict any changes in UI - will help speed up approval and deployment.

All PRs against `main` automatically generate Fleek previews to make it easier to "check your work". You can view your PR's preview by clicking `Details` in the `fleek/build` check at the bottom of your PR page:<br/>

A reviewer will be by shortly to have a look!
