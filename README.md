**This repository contains code and content for the [official IPFS Project website](https://ipfs.tech)**, located at https://ipfs.tech. This site acts as a high-level overview of the IPFS project, offering valuable introductory information and next-steps pathways for prospective and current IPFS users and developers, members of the press, and more.

Please note that some sites closely related to this primary IPFS website have their own repos:
- [IPFS Blog & News](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-blog)
- [IPFS Ecosystem Directory](https://github.com/ipfs/ecosystem-directory)
- [IPFS Documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs)

## For site developers

### Build and run locally

To build a local copy, run the following:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

### PR and preview

Once you're happy with your local changes, please make a PR **against the `main` branch**. Including detailed notes on your PR - particularly screenshots to depict any changes in UI - will help speed up approval and deployment.

All PRs against `main` automatically generate Fleek previews to make it easier to "check your work". You can view your PR's preview by clicking `Details` in the `fleek/build` check at the bottom of your PR page:<br/>
