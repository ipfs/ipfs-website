      As people learn about IPFS, they also get a view of IPFS as a component in a broader ecosystem. It's not an island. It's not a technology that lives entirely on its own, it's a piece of a broader stack of something. We see it as an onramp to broader decentralization.

      I use NFT.storage for my digital art. It was such a relief to know that I could store my videos in one placeâ€”each one with its own IPFS URL and CID. Resilience is important to me and having the work backed up to Filecoin means they'll be around for a long time.
