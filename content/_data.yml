      As people learn about IPFS, they also get a view of IPFS as a component in a broader ecosystem. It's not an island. It's not a technology that lives entirely on its own, it's a piece of a broader stack of something. We see it as an onramp to broader decentralization.

      I use NFT.storage for my digital art. It was such a relief to know that I could store my videos in one place—each one with its own IPFS URL and CID. Resilience is important to me and having the work backed up to Filecoin means they'll be around for a long time.
