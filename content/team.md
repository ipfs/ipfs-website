title: The IPFS team
description: Learn how the global IPFS team asynchronously collaborates to decentralize the web.
---

IPFS is the collective work of thousands of contributors from multiple geographies and backgrounds, working <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt#how-we-work-together">collaboratively and asynchronously</a> to decentralize the web.

We organize ourselves into focused teams called Working Groups. Each group defines its own roadmap, objectives and priorities. You can find more information about this group structure in the [team management repo](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/blob/master/TEAMS_ROLES_STRUCTURES.md#working-groups).

The IPFS Working Groups are:

- [**Project**](#project)
- [**Content Routing**](#content-routing)
- [**Testground**](#testground)
- [**Ecosystem**](#ecosystem)

There are also Special Interest Groups, pushing forward research and development on:

- [Project](#project)
- [Content Routing](#content-routing)
- [Testground](#testground)
- [Bifrost](#bifrost)
- [Ecosystem](#ecosystem)
- [Special Interest Groups](#special-interest-groups)
  - [Collabs and Community](#collabs-and-community)
  - [Developer Experience](#developer-experience)
  - [Integration with Web Browsers](#integration-with-web-browsers)
  - [IPFS GUI/UX](#ipfs-guiux)
  - [Local Offline Collaboration (Locol)](#local-offline-collaboration-locol)
